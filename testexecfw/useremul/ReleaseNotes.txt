[Resolved Issues]
- Bug 1358 - UserEmulator bug fixes related to Script recording and playback

[Known Issues]
1. Key emulations to java midlets are not working properly
   Ex. Music store
2. Alphanumeric keypad is not working with script recording. Workaround for this issue is to 
   manually create the script by adding the tag <keys> <name> </keys>
   - Recording Hash press for copy and paste is not supported in the alphanumeric keypad. 
3. During replay User Emulator has speed issues sometimes. It can't replay events as fast as it should and
    this can cause differences between recording and replay.
4. In order to get the same results during script execution, all the screens on the device should be reset to 
    its initial state before script recording and playback. 
    o Currently the tool supports basic reset functionality of resetting the Menu application's scroll bar, 
      closing any open applications on the device and resetting the idle screen. 
    o If there are any changes to the application position in the Menu application or any changes on the 
      HomeScreen, the script when played back may not produce the same results. This is a known limitation of the tool.
5. On some 3.1/3.2 devices a menu opens in Idle screen instead of screen reset.
6. Scripts recorded earlier will not work with the latest release and they have to be used with older version of UE.  ( <= v4.2_1309)!
